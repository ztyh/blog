Generally it is more expensive than buying in Japan. US charge is USD90.60 in total where as original Japanese prices are USD78.52. Maybe the Japanese price didn't include tax, which is 8 percent so that makes USD84.80. Why doesn't the US mont-bell doesn't charge any tax? At least on the receipt the tax amount is put down as USD0.
