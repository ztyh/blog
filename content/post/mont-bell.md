I bought the following from mont-bell. The three prices are the Japanese price on the tag, the price I paid for the US mont-bell operation, and the the Japanese price in dollors as of 10/28/2018 20:36 EST.
  
chameece muffler ¥1100 USD10.40 USD9.79  
mini clear bottle 20ml ¥260 USD2.7 USD2.31  
cotton twill hat L ¥2200 USD17.50 USD19.58  
cable knit work cap ¥2762 USD31 USD24.58  
breeze spun hunting cap ¥2500 USD29 USD22.25  
  
Generally it is more expensive than buying in Japan but the product is good so I can live with it. I paid USD90.60 in total where as I could have gone by with USD78.52. But I think maybe the Japanese price didn't include tax, which is 8 percent so that makes USD84.80. I mean its not bad but I will put off buying more as I will go to Japan for Winter break. I'm wondering why the US mont-bell doesn't charge any tax? At least on the receipt the tax amount is put down as USD0.
